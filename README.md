## low_cost_speed_sensor
### Aim: Develop a low cost speed measuring device from 2 HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors

### Current Status:
Reads accurately 10% of the time, most likely due to interference as both HCSR04 sensors operate on same frequency.
Experimenting with tubes around sensors to reduce interference. (Error readings are always very far from expected value, eg 60 m/s when expecting 1 m/s)

### Why did I start this:
Developing cheap, reliable sensors that can measure a passing object's speed and direction are a stepping stone necessary for other projects I had in mind, in particular an Agricultural Safety Device.

#### However, this has plenty of other applications, such as an entry level speed training device for sports clubs. Current laser speed measuring tech is highly expensive. Ultrasonic sensors are much cheaper with the downside of lesser accuracy. Could be affordable to members of teams to use in their own time.
